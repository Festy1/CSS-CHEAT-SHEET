                    All positioned elements have their z-index set to auto (effectively, zero). Elements with higher integer z-index values will take precedence over those will lower ones, and will be displayed on top of the latter.</td>

                <td>If an element has a z-index of 5, and that this is the highest value for this property compared to other elements, the effect would be
                     no different if it had a z-index value of 2500. What would matter here is that it has the highest value.</td>

                <td>elative positioning allows one to alter the position of an element in relation to where it was in the normal flow.
                    This can be achieved using top, bottom, left and right properties. It is possible to cause the element in question to overlap with other elements.</td>

                    The space where it was will not remain unoccupied, as it can happen with relative positioning.

                     The containing element will not necessarily be the parent element of the styled element â€” but it can be so if 
                     the parent element is positioned to something other than static.</td>

                <td>This positioning removes the element in question out of the normal document flow. Some tweaking may be 
                    necessary to adjacent elements so they, for example, are not hidden by the fixed element.This property 
                    can be useful for, for example, fixing a navigation bar to the top of the page so that it remains in view 
                    as users scroll down. For this positioning to work correctly, you will need to have layout properties such as top and left set.</td>

                <td>position: sticky;</td>
                <td>This positioning could, for example, have a nagivation bar move with the page up to a certain point, 
                    and thereafter remain fixed as the page continues scrolling. Use the z-index property to keep the styled element above other elements on the page if necessary.</td>
